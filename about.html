This is Dr.Jim Junle Liu. I earned my bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2020 June, and my Ph.D. degree from the The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), in 2024 Oct. My research interests include fluid dynamics, Large Eddy Simulation (LES)-based numerical analysis, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted fluid flow analysis, and AI-enhanced CFD. 

I have published papers in top-tier journals, such as Engineering Structures, Physics of Fluids, and Building & Environment. 

If you have any questions about my research, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for visiting my website.
