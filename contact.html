<p>This is Dr.Jim Junle Liu. I earned my bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2020 June, and my Ph.D. degree from the The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), in 2024 Oct. My research interests include computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms for 3D shape analysis, 3D reconstruction, and 3D modeling. 

I am also interested in applying these algorithms to various applications, such as computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and computer-aided surgery. 

I have published papers in top-tier conferences and journals, such as SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, CVPR, ICCV, and TPAMI. 

I have also served as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals, such as SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, CVPR, ICCV, and TPAMI. 

I have received several awards for my research, such as the Best Paper Award at SIGGRAPH Asia 2013 and the Best Paper Award at CVPR 2014. I am a member of the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM SIGGRAPH. I am also a member of the editorial board of the journal Computer Graphics Forum. If you have any questions about my research, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
